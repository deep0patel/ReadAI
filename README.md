# ReadAI

## Description

This is a python web application. You can load multiple books in the form of pdf. This books will be split and stored in chunks. This chunks are converted to Embeddings(high dimensional vectors) which will be stored locally. Spliiting and  storing takes time depending on your device. 

On the first page you will be asked to enter your openAI api key. Get it from openAI's website and enter it. This key will be stored as session variable and will be erased as soon as the application closes. So, you will have to keep it in handy place to use the application again.
